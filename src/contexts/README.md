## Context Integration Patterns

### Business Process Integration
```typescript
// Example: Requirement creation triggering stakeholder notifications
const { createRequirement } = useRequirement();
const { notifyStakeholders } = useStakeholder();
const { logActivity } = useCompliance();

const handleRequirementCreation = async (requirementData) => {
  const requirement = await createRequirement(requirementData);
  await notifyStakeholders(requirement);
  await logActivity('requirement_created', { requirementId: requirement.id });
};
```

### Cross-Context Data Flow
1. **User Authentication** → **Role-Based Access** → **Feature Availability**
2. **Requirement Creation** → **Stakeholder Matching** → **Notification Delivery**
3. **Proposal Submission** → **Approval Workflow** → **Award Notification**
4. **Project Execution** → **Milestone Tracking** → **Payment Processing**

### Performance Optimization Patterns

// Example: Testing stakeholder approval workflow
describe('StakeholderContext', () => {
  it('should progress stakeholder through qualification workflow', async () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useStakeholder());
    
    // Test invitation process
    await act(async () => {
      await result.current.sendInvitation(mockInvitation);
    });
    
    // Test pre-qualification
    await act(async () => {
      const passed = await result.current.preQualifyStakeholder(stakeholderId, assessmentData);
      expect(passed).toBe(true);
    });
    
    // Verify audit trail
    const auditTrail = result.current.getStakeholderAuditTrail(stakeholderId);
    expect(auditTrail).toContain('invitation_sent');
    expect(auditTrail).toContain('pre_qualification_completed');
  });
});
```

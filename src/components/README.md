## Component Integration Patterns

### State Management
- **Business Context**: Components consume business-specific contexts (StakeholderContext, RequirementContext)
- **User Context**: Role-based access control and feature availability
- **Notification Context**: Real-time updates and user communication
- **Performance Context**: Monitoring and optimization metrics

### Data Flow Patterns
```
User Interaction → Component → Business Logic Hook → Context Update → API Call → Audit Log → UI Update
```

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Components handle missing data gracefully
2. **User-Friendly Messages**: Business-context error messages
3. **Audit Trail**: Error logging for compliance and debugging
4. **Recovery Mechanisms**: User-guided error recovery processes

## Testing Strategy for Business Components

### Component-Level Testing

- **User Interaction Testing**: Validate complete user workflows
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure compliance with accessibility standards
- **Performance Testing**: Validate enterprise-scale performance

### Integration Testing
- **Cross-Component Workflows**: Test complete business processes
- **Context Integration**: Validate state management across components
- **API Integration**: Test external service integration
- **Compliance Validation**: Ensure ISO 9001 requirement fulfillment

## Common Questions

**Q: Can vendors see all my messages?**
A: No, vendors only see messages in conversations where they're participants. Internal team messages are private.

**Q: How long are messages stored?**
A: Messages are stored permanently. You can access full history anytime.

**Q: Can I unsend a message?**
A: You can delete a message, but if the recipient has already read it, they've seen it. Delete removes it from the conversation view.

**Q: How do I know if a message was read?**
A: Read receipts may be shown (depends on settings). Blue checkmarks typically indicate read status.

**Q: Can I message a vendor before they submit a quotation?**
A: Only if you have their contact. Public requirements don't reveal your identity until you choose to engage.

**Q: Are message attachments secure?**
A: Yes, all attachments are encrypted and stored securely. Only conversation participants can access them.

**Q: Can I export chat history?**
A: Depending on your role and settings, you may be able to export conversation history for record-keeping.
